# Introduction
  This is just a custom page that I created for my own browser startup as my existing page was kindoff boring and I wanted a new and more lively one with     my own direct links to my most used sites it does save me some time plus i just wanted to create something of my own to show the world. Feel free to use   it. Sorry for the unorganized code.
